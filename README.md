# “FUNCY CAFE APP”
This cafe sells several types of coffees 
## PROBLEM
The cafe needs a simple web application to display its menu and and their prices allowing  customers add coffee and buns items to their cart.
The cafe owner wants an easy way for customers to see what’s available and keep track or modify their orders or incase the customers want to delete they can do it or remove the an item from cart.

### SOLUTION
I will create a basic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve this problem.
This app displays the cafe remaining items, allows customers to add items to their cart, and shows the total price of their order.
Here a user can add items using the addOrder.
If a user wants to view the orders can use viewOrder.
Incase the user wants to apdate his order can use Update.
Incase of any change of mind they will use deleteOrder.


#### Crude operations to be used
THINGS TO USE
Use viewOrder
Use addOrder
Update an existing order
deleteOrder
